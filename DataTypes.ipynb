    "# Beginner's Guide to Python User Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will teach you how to use Python's `input()` function to take user input for various data types. We'll cover:\n",
    "- Basic usage of `input()`\n",
    "- Converting input into different data types\n",
    "- Handling invalid input with error checking\n",
    "- Examples for all major Python data types\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to interact with users in your Python programs!\n",

    "### **1. Basics of `input()`**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## What is `input()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` function is used to take input from the user. It pauses the program until the user enters a value and presses Enter. By default, `input()` returns the value as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If you ask the user for their name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Basic input\n",
    "name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Converting Input to Numbers**\n",
    "#### **a. Integer Input**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Integer Input\n",
    "\n",
    "To take integer input, use the `int()` function to convert the string returned by `input()` into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "If you ask the user for their age:\n",
    "```\n",
    "age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n",
    "print(f\"You are {age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Integer input\n",
    "age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n",
    "print(f\"You are {age} years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Float Input**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Float Input\n",
    "\n",
    "For decimal numbers, use the `float()` function to convert the string into a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "If you ask the user for a price:\n",
    "```\n",
    "price = float(input(\"Enter the price: \"))\n",
    "print(f\"The price is ${price:.2f}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Float input\n",
    "price = float(input(\"Enter the price: \"))\n",
    "print(f\"The price is ${price:.2f}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Handling Invalid Input (Error Checking)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "## Handling Invalid Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes users might enter invalid data (e.g., entering text when a number is expected). To handle this gracefully, use a `try`-`except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask for an integer and handle invalid input:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "        print(f\"You entered: {age}\")\n",
    "        break  # Exit loop if valid input is provided\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Error handling for integer input\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "        print(f\"You entered: {age}\")\n",
    "        break  # Exit loop if valid input is provided\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid integer.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Taking Input for Different Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. String (`str`)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Strings are sequences of characters and are the default return type of `input()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask for a user's favorite color.\n",
    "```\n",
    "color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n",
    "print(f\"Your favorite color is {color}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: String input\n",
    "color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n",
    "print(f\"Your favorite color is {color}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. List (`list`)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "To take a list as input, split the user's response into multiple items using `.split()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask for a list of favorite fruits.\n",
    "```\n",
    "fruits = input(\"Enter your favorite fruits separated by commas: \").split(\",\")\n",
    "print(f\"Your favorite fruits are: {fruits}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: List input\n",
    "fruits = input(\"Enter your favorite fruits separated by commas: \").split(\",\")\n",
    "print(f\"Your favorite fruits are: {fruits}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Dictionary (`dict`)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "To take dictionary input, use `eval()` cautiously or parse JSON-like strings using `json.loads()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask for key-value pairs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "data = json.loads(input(\"Enter key-value pairs as JSON (e.g., {'key1': 'value1'}): \"))\n",
    "print(f\"You entered: {data}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Dictionary input using JSON parsing (safe approach)\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "data = json.loads(input(\"Enter key-value pairs as JSON (e.g., {'key1': 'value1'}): \"))\n",
    "print(f\"You entered: {data}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. Boolean (`bool`)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Booleans represent truth values (`True` or `False`). Convert user input using comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask if the user likes Python.\n",
    "```\n",
    "likes_python = input(\"Do you like Python? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n",
    "print(f\"Likes Python: {likes_python}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Boolean input\n",
    "likes_python = input(\"Do you like Python? (yes/no): \").lower() == \"yes\"\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Advanced Input Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Range (`range`)**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Ranges represent sequences of numbers defined by start, stop, and step values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Ask for range parameters.\n",
    "```\n",
    "start = int(input(\"Enter start of range: \"))\n",
    "stop = int(input(\"Enter end of range (exclusive): \"))\n",
    "step = int(input(\"Enter step size: \"))\n",
    "numbers = range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "print(f\"Generated range: {list(numbers)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Try it below!\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Range input\n",
    "start = int(input(\"Enter start of range: \"))\n",
    "stop = int(input(\"Enter end of range (exclusive): \"))\n",
    "step = int(input(\"Enter step size: \"))\n",
    "numbers = range(start, stop, step)\n",
